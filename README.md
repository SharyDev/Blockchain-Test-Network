## Blockchain Consensus Algorithms

This repository contains an exploration of various Blockchain Consensus Algorithms.

### Included Algorithms:

#### Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm in which miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks.

#### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Proof-of-Stake is a consensus algorithm where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

#### Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET)

Proof-of-Elapsed-Time is a consensus algorithm primarily used in distributed systems where participants are required to wait for a randomly selected time period before being able to add a new block to the chain.

## Purpose

This repository serves as to explore and understand the fundamental concepts and mechanisms behind different consensus algorithms in Blockchain technology.
